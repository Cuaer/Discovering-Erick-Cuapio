Web Portfolio: Discovering - Erick Cuapio

In this assignment, we were asked to create a web portfolio from scratch.

I applied several of the techniques we learned in class.

I included an interactive navigation bar which also changes in size depending on the size of the device being used to view the page.

I made sure to include an about me section, a link to previous work linked to an image, my contact information, and a link to my social media within an image.
